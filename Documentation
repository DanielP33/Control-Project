# Control Center Ubuntu
(general setup)
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname controlcenter
sudo reboot

nano chave.pem
(placed my private key here)

nano debian.sh
"ssh -i chave.pem admin@172.31.31.120"

(when i type sh debian.sh it executes that script
so i dont have to type the whole command)

cp debian.sh redhat.sh
"ssh -i chave.pem ec2-user@172.31.26.167"
(same as before but for redhat)

I decided I wanted a graphical interface.
(Xfce chosen because it's performance friendly)

sudo apt install -y xfce4 xfce4-goodies
sudo apt install -y xrdp chromium-browser
sudo su -
sudo passwd ubuntu (password here so we can login through rdp)

(I shall now proceed with the Wazuh installation.)
